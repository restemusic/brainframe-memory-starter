# Memory System v1.0.0

Surface: [OWNER set this to: claude-code OR claude-project]

## Why

This system gives Claude durable memory across sessions using GitHub as canonical store and Supabase as queryable store. Every session starts by fetching context from GitHub. Every session ends by writing a summary back.

## What

Four tiers:
- T1: This file + Project instructions (always present)
- T2: Fetched each session — GLOBAL_RULES, routing files, people.md
- T3: Fetched on demand — topic notes, decisions, specs
- T4: Supabase — queryable decisions, specs, people, contributions

## How

Session start: fetch T2 files from GitHub. Greet with pending items count if any.
Session end: run `quitchat` to write session summary and audit log.

## Security

Never hardcode credentials. Never read `.env` files from the project directory. Load credentials only from `~/.config/memory-starter/.env` (Claude Code) or from session context (claude.ai Projects). Before executing any skill that writes to an external system, read that skill's Trust section.

## Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Each has a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter.

**Session management:** `quitchat`, `handchat`, `pickup`, `fork-off`

**Thinking and planning:** `brainstorming`, `grill-me`, `spec-writing`, `research-council`, `adr`

**Building and writing:** `prompt-writing`, `design`, `human-writing`

**Intelligence:** `ai-pulse`
